<title>First 10 Games Added to BGG</title>
<description>These are the first 10 games that were added to the database back in January 2000.  These games are in the database in this order due to the old Metrogamers website reviews.  These were games reviewed by either Derk Solko or Neil Carr back in the day.

Sorry for not putting much in the way of descriptions.  This is pretty much a test list.</description>

Of course, the reason for this bizarre start is because of the session report which started it all off, http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewfullsession.php3?groupname=Metrogamers&amp;dateofsession=19990214 .  Ahh, back in the day.  When this database was still a glimmer in Aldie's eye.

Just noticed there are holes in the list, and about 1/2 way through the list, the list item numbers don't match the bgg game id... the following games are missing all together that have a game id &lt;= 10?  Or were 6 &amp; 8 actually added later?

Game id #6: [gameid=6]
Game id #8: [gameid=8]

First comment in 2015!!!!

Just stumbled upon this by going [i]humm, I wonder what the first geeklist is?[/i]  

Gotta say, the dates don't make any sense, and I'm assuming that a couple old-timer's comments got deleted when they deleted their accounts.

Why where the dates messed with?  And when was this thing actually created?  It says 2006....can't be right.

Aldie created the first 5 entries in 2001.
Then he needed a short break, and finished the list in 2006.

They do sit flush with the table, if, and only if, you screw around with them for 5 or 10 minutes to make them do so. To a first approximation, if you make the middle part parallel to the parts two spaces either side, and then make the end bit parallel to the one next to the middle piece on that side, it should lie flush.

However, easier said than done.

"Living rules" refers to the idea of continuously rewriting an original (or older) document to reflect modern ideas and rules.  There are a lot of people who would like to do the same to the United States Constitution.

In other words, the rules for this game are constantly being updated to reflect new ideas and rules that were written for other games (or later for this game) but can be used to "fix" this game.

No, thats not it at all. "Living rules" is a term from the wargaming community.  It means - bearing in mind the complexity of those games - to fix errors and "patch" in new/modified rules to take care of obscure situations that have arisen in play.

What happened to the date?  

Is this a past shadow of a future projection in order to test the database structure (kind of like reading "1984" in 2006) or are we actually looking at a cheap reproduction of the original posting of RA to this GeekList?

Either way this is deeply suspicious--I recommend forming a committee to investigate!
