						               													<description>Hijara ... 2-player abstract strategy board game of concentration &amp;ndash; using placement of small stones, strategy and points accumulation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original game was named Excel and published by American Airlines, Inc. in their in flight magazine American Way on December 24th 1985 and July 22nd 1986 &amp;ndash; U.S.A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Excel was later published as Eclipse by Games Above Board in 1994 and included in Games Magazine 1995 Buyers Guide To Games &amp;ndash; U.S.A.&amp;#10; Excel/Eclipse, renamed Hijara (Arabic for small stones), was published by Great American Trading Company in 1995 and has been in Games Magazine Top 100 since 1996.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was then published as Hijara by Sunnywood, Sterling Games in 2004 &amp;ndash; Hong Kong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also published as Hijara in February 2012 by Ducosim &amp;ndash; The Netherlands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has been knocked off 4 times &amp;hellip; electronic flash versions (Russia &amp;amp; U.S.A.) + Android (Belgium) and iPhone (India) apps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play: start with an empty board, end with a full board and the player who accrues the most points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The three ways to score points:&amp;#10;4 numbers of a kind in a row - horizontally, vertically, diagonally scores 10 points.&amp;#10;4 numbers in sequence in a row - horizontally, vertically, diagonally scores 15 points.&amp;#10;4 numbers in a square scores 20 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two additional optional ways to score points:&amp;#10;4 numbers of a kind in the 4 corner squares scores 10 points.&amp;#10;4 numbers in sequence in the 4 corner squares scores 15 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You snooze, you lose - as overlooked points are forfeited.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A singular game for two with only one rule - i.e. numbered squares may be filled in any order however, stones must be placed on the square [being filled] in numerical sequence of that square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FYI &amp;ndash; contrary to ValJor's opinion and as proved to him (by playing a game), as the game is played for points, the second player cannot break Hijara.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
